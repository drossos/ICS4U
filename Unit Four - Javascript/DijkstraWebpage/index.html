	<p id="Description">
		Edsger Wybe Dijsktra was a Dutch computer scientist. One of his most famous contributions to the field was Dijkstra's Algorithm. An algorithm that given a start node on a weighted graph will find the shortest distance to every other node on the graph and the route taken. This results in a final graph that contains the shortest path to get to each node. Dijkstra algorithm works with both directed and undirected graphs, but one requirement is that all edges have non negative weights.

		Below is an example to demonstrate the algorithm in action. Verbal explanation for each step is also found under the demonstration. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the steps.

	<h1>Explanation</h1>
	<p id = "descriptions">
		We start out with a weighted graph. All the nodes have a value that indicates the distance to get to that point from the starting node. Starting out before we pick a starting node we consider all of them to have a value of infinity

	<p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used in geographical mapping, in IP routing, telephone networking and it is used by Google maps to determine fastest distance to points.

	<h1> Pseudocode </h1>
	<pre>
//Pseudocode credited to gitta.info

function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
	for each vertex v in Graph:			// Initialization
		dist[v] := infinity			// initial distance from source to vertex v is set to infinite
		previous[v] := undefined		// Previous node in optimal path from source
	dist[source] := 0				// Distance from source to source
	Q := the set of all nodes in Graph		// all nodes in the graph are unoptimized - thus are in Q
	while Q is not empty:				// main loop
		u := node in Q with smallest dist[ ]
		remove u from Q
		for each neighbor v of u:		// where v has not yet been removed from Q.
			alt := dist[u] + dist_between(u, v)
			if alt < dist[v]		// Relax (u,v)
				dist[v] := alt
				previous[v] := u
	return previous[ ]
